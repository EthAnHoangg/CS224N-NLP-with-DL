# Acknowledgement

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my instructor Ngo Van Linh for guiding and supporting me throughout this project. His expertise, feedback, and encouragement have been invaluable in helping me deepen my understanding of NLP and exploring, implementing the techniques learned in the CS224n course.

I would also like to thank the CS224n teaching team at Stanford University for providing an excellent course that equipped me with the foundational knowledge and advanced techniques in NLP.

# Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a rapidly evolving field that has gained significant attention in recent years. NLP involves the study and development of algorithms and models to process and analyze human language. With the proliferation of digital communication and the explosion of social media platforms, there is an ever-increasing demand for effective and efficient methods for extracting insights from unstructured text data.

The purpose of this project is to explore the field of NLP and apply the techniques learned in the CS224n course from Stanford University. CS224n is a comprehensive course that covers the foundational concepts and advanced methods in NLP, such as word embeddings, neural language models.
